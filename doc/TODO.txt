1.  Move to authlogic
2.	Implement inherited controllers
3.  Use CanCan for authorization (instead of declarative_authorisation)
4.  Set sessions cookies to the domain (not subdomain) since users can access multiple accounts

1.  Create a plugin that handles authentication based upon authlogic (move User & Session models and controllers + views so it's an engine as well).  Use authlogic etc etc etc

2. use subdomain-fu as a gem, not plugin
