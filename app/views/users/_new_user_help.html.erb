<p>New users are created on this page. The <em>User name</em> is the name that will be used to log into the system.  It can be any text entry but you should
bear in mind that once the user is created this name <em>cannot later be changed</em>.</p>
<p>
As an <em>account administrator</em> you are authorizing access for another person to access your account. You must define the role that the new person will hold on your account.  The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Account User</em> (the default option) which authorizes as user to log into your account and to be able to view analytical information relating to specific web properties that you authorize for this user.  You can select the web properties that the new user can view using the available check boxes.  You should change specific authorization to individual web properties by visiting the <%= link_to "web properties", properties_path %> page at any time.
</li>
<li><em>Account Administrator</em> which authorizes the new user to manage and administer your account.  Selecting this option gives the new user the same authority and access as you have so it should be carefully and selectively given to new users.
</li>
</ul>
