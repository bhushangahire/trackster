== Welcome to Trackster

A simple (and only in early development) web analytics server.


Controllers:
	1.  Controller should have short and long form (of belongs_to), detect and behave appropriately
		ie.  /properties/24/campaign/35 OR /campaign/35 only difference is to know which owner
		
	2.	Scoping need to be finished.  Can be have a generalised scoper for the three different
		user classes? (Admin, Account Owner, User)
